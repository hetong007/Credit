The whole procedure should be like this:

do cv --> put in pool --> combine pool and do the ensemble exam --> prediction on test.

1.Do CV
	Every model should be written in a single file under the directory CV with file name indicating its model.
	
2.Put in pool
	Record everything needed in the future:
	Pool, auc, variables chosen and other parameters.
	Related files should be in the directory PoolGeneration
	
3. Combine pool and do the ensemble exam
	Combine pools and records. Especially the mapping between ids and other attributes.
	Do the ensemble and record the ID and AUC for each exam.
	Related files should be in the directory Ensemble.
	
4. Prediction on test
	According to the recorded ID and corresponding models and parameters, train them on train and predict on test.
	Combine the predicting result and map it to [0,1].
	Submit the result.
	Related files should be in the directory Submission.
